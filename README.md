# jqueryDropdown
This is a simple jQuery Dropdown select built for the use on Lionbridge.com as a menu.
The goal is that the dropdown can:
 - Be styled as the client sees fit
 - Be SEO optimized: that means it can contain valid <a> tags which will be read by web crawlers
 
Feel free to use this without asking. I probably won't update it, document it, or add features once I'm happy with it.
